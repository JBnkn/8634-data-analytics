This repository contains my analysis of the famous [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

This analysis was done as my project for the [Principles of Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/principles-of-data-analytics) module as part of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at ATU](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics).
